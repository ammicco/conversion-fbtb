very simple c program that convert small numbers from a base to another.
based on 3 function: 
 - convert decimal to another base.
 - convert number in a base in decimal. 
 - third function that combine the other two for convert any base to another. 
there's also a simple error handler in two case: 
 - indicate a wrong base. 
 - indicate less arguments.
